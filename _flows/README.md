# node-red flows

To use all flows you need to install some dependencies for your node-red installation.

```shell
"node-red-contrib-buffer-array": "~1.1.0",
"node-red-contrib-dlink-dspw": "~1.0.1",
"node-red-contrib-nexmo": "~3.1.1",
"node-red-contrib-web-worldmap": "~1.5.39",
"node-red-dashboard": "~2.15.2",        "node-red-node-random": "~0.1.2"
```

You can simply add those to your `package.json`.     

Afterwards you are ready to go. Now you can import either all flows or one of the flows contained in the single_flows folder.
